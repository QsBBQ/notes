    D3.js: which will render our charts. D3 creates svg based charts which are passed into html div blocks.
    Dc.js: which we will use as a wrapper for D3.js. This allows us to only have to add the basic chart parameters to our code to get them up and running.
    Crossfilter.js: which is used for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. Really great for slicing and dicing data. Enables drill down based analysis.
    queue.js: an asynchronous helper library for data ingestion involving multiple apiâ€™s. Its job is to wait until the data is available from each api before passing on the combined data for processing.
    Dc.css: contains the styling directives for our dc charts.
    keen.js: a dashboard template library.
    bootstrap: used in conjunction with keen.js to layout our dashboard elements.
