# Using Python with MySQL Part One—Intro
  Connect to a MySQL database
  Query what tables are available in your database
  Query what columns and column types your tables contain
  Close connections and why you need to

  #Connect to a mysql db
    -file folder org
      <your project>
              |
               – database
              |          |
              |           – __init__py
              |          |
              |           – mysql.py
              |
               – main.py
              |
               – settings.py
    -installing mysql python
      note: mysql-python only works on 2.7 not 3.
      export PATH=$PATH:/usr/LOCAL/mysql/bin
      pip install mysql-python
    -Creating a connection
        import MySQLdb AS _mysql
        db = _mysql.CONNECT(db=database_name,
                          host=host,
                          USER=username,
                          passwd=password)
    -running queries
      Before we can issue commands,
      we need to create something called a ‘cursor’,
      which acts pretty much like the cursor in your window or word processor would.
      It allows you to park your place in the data.
      -cursor
      cursor = db.cursor()
      cursor.EXECUTE("SELECT * FROM my_table;")

      results = cursor.fetchall()

      cursor.close()

    - show COLUMNS
        USE my_db;
        SHOW COLUMNS FROM <TABLE name>:
