## Data Visualization and D3!!

  -Intro
    It is like summoning a magical, visual genie out of an inscrutable data bottle.
    What is D3
    SVG
    D3 Setup
    Selectors with Chrome Developer tools
  -What is D3
    D3 defined
    D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents.
    bring that data to life using HTML, CSS, and SVG (which we will look at very soon).
    -D3 does the following
      Loads the data
      Binds the data to elements
      Transforms the data to a visual output
      Transitions elements based upon triggered events
    You provide the concept, you craft the rules, and D3 executes it—without telling you what to do.

 -Scalable Vector Graphics
   SCALABLE VECTOR GRAPHICS (SVG)
   (free program that can draw svg's Inkscape )
   -The SVG Element
     SVG provides tags for circles, rectangles, and lines etc.
     <svg width = "500" height = "500">
     </svg>
  Beside <rect> there are a number of other elements we can use.
  These include circle, line, ellipse, path, and text.

  SVG takes many of its properties from the world of graphics, which has its own terminology.
  We have seen this concept in examples such as where css would use border, svg uses stroke, and for background-color they use fill.
  SVG also inherit positioning from the graphics world. Where  x = 0,  y = 0 is the top left corner, not the bottom left as one might assume, as shown below:
  -Line()
    <line x1="120" y1="20" x2="400" y2="220"/>
  -Text()
    <text x="200" y="40" class="svgText">SVG Text!</text>
  -Overlapping
    As you have probably noticed, when elements overlap, the order of the elements dictate which element ends up on top.
    Each element is stacked above its predecessor.
  -Styling SVG Elements
    -fill
      hex, rgb, rgba
    -stroke
      hex, rgb, rgba
    -stroke-width
      default px
    -opacity
      0 or 1

    -D3 selectors
      d3.select("p")
      var body = d3.select("body")
      body.append("p").text("I love data")
      var myDiv = d3.select("div")
      myDiv.append("p").text("paragraph in div")
      myDiv.attr("style", "background-color:#ddd")
      myDiv.attr("style", "border:solid 4px black")
      myDiv.attr("style", "background-color:#ddd", "border:solid 4px black")
      myDiv.classed("smallBox", true);
      myDiv.classed("smallBox", false);
      -note
        Attr will overwrite any classes the element already has which can be a problem.
        The classed method will append a class onto those already available.
      - myDiv.remove()
