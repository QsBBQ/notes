## Form validation outside the form
  In our form we will set two scope properties:

  uniqueusername
  uniqueemail
  We will set these to true or false after our call to our backend service.
  True is ok – but false will trigger an error message.

  $scope.submitted = false;
  $scope.uniqueusername = true;
  $scope.uniqueemail = true;

  $scope.registerForm = function(registerForm) {
      if (registerForm.$valid) {
             $scope.submitted = true;
             //continue with form processing
             //use a service to check for validity of username
             $scope.uniqueusername = false; //will trigger error
             //use a service to check for validity of email
             $scope.uniqueemail = true;
             if ($scope.uniqueusername &amp;&amp;
                 $scope.uniqueusemail ) {
                        // proceed to process form via backend service
                        // if successful, route to validated page
                        }
             }
      else {
            console.log("form is invalid");
            $scope.submitted = true;
             }
    }

# $Location service
  Angular has a service that allows us to route to a new location using the service $location.
  We can add $location as a parameter to a controller and using its .path() function route to a new location (make sure the path is a valid route).

      $location.path(‘location’);
      ie. $location.path(‘/details/’+$scope.register.username);
