## User Experience
## UX
GARRETT’S ELEMENTS OF UX STACK
Concrete to abstract.
-Surface
  The Surface Layer describes finished visual design aspects.
-Skeleton
  The Skeleton describes screen layout and functional compartments in the screen.
-Structure
  Structure defines navigation from place to place in the User Interface.
-Scope
  The places in the User Interface are built to support user task-centric scope.
-Strategy
  Business goals drive user constituencies and contexts supported to form strategy.

##User Experience
##User Experience determines how a person feels when interacting with a system.

##Users
  -USER CENTERED DESIGN
    This refers to a class of methodologies where design decisions are based on some tangible user model. That user model must be based on the research of the users of the application.
  -Designers
    UX designers are primarily concerned with how the product feels.
    Unlike UX designers who are concerned with the overall feel of the product, UI designers are particular about how the product is laid out.
    A visual designer is the one who pushes pixels.
  -Understanding the users
    To understand our users more, we can investigate them to try to understand their motives and needs.
    We can group them in a general manner or drill right down to create personas.
    -Actor&Goal
      Often a job title or the common name for the type of user in a system.

      Example:

      On-line Shopper: browses and purchases merchandise online
    -user role
      A short name describing a user in pursuit of a goal – users change roles as their goals change.

      Casual Browser:  passes time by browsing products online
      Comparison Shopper: compare prices and features for items he/she wishes to buy
      Gift Shopper: finds a gift for someone that likes the types of products a website sells
      Impatient Buyer: finds what he/she needs and gets through the checkout process quickly
    -user profile
      Adding summary information about the types of users who fill a role or perform as an actor begins a process of “profiling”.

      Users: 50,000 customers visit this sporting goods website monthly
      Activities: browsing, price comparing, gift shopping, handling returns
      Computer Skills: vary wildly from first time users to expert – although moderate computer skills are typical
      Domain expertise: typical customers are avid outdoor enthusiasts
    -persona
      Choosing specific characteristics of a person and compiling those into a archetypal description of that person creates a strong design target.

  -Building personas
    Personas are based on research, e.g. interviews, contextual enquiry, observation, focus groups, surveys, literature reviews, etc.
    Personas:

      Describe users’ behavioural patterns, goals, and motivation
      Are represented as individual people
      Express and focus on the major needs and expectations of the most important user groups
      Give a clear picture of the user’s expectations and how they’re likely to use the site
      Aid in uncovering universal features and functionality
    From the user research, we can construct personas and a User Story, which allow us to recreate the user experience for a very specific user.
      What attributes do our users have in common?
      What attributes vary within our user group?

-Actors
  Everyone that needs a car. personal/business
-roles
  Business user
  commuter
  person on vacation
-profiles
  Users: thousands of single car families need a car
  Activities: going to a event
  computer skills: some
  domain expertise: normal person
-personas
  What would Bob think of this?
  Are we meeting bobs needs?
  Will Bob achieve his goal?

#Usability
  Usability refers to the ability of a specific type of user to be able to effectively carry out a task using a product.
  -Design and usability principles
    There are existing and evolving standards for interaction design.
    One of the ‘Gurus’ of usability and interaction design is Jakob Nielsen.
    He has developed ‘10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design’.
    They are called “heuristics” because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific guidelines.
    -visiblity of system status
       The system should always keep users informed about what is going on,
       through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
    -Match between system and the real world
        The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.
        Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
    -User control and freedom
        Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.
        Support undo and redo.
    -Consistency and standards
        Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.
        Follow platform conventions.
    -Error prevention
        Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.
    -Recognition rather than recall
        Minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. T
    -Flexibility and efficiency of use
        Accelerators – unseen by the novice user – may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.
    -aesthetic and minimalist design
        Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.
    -Help users recognize diagnose and recover errors
        Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes)
    -Help and Documentation
        provide help and documentation
