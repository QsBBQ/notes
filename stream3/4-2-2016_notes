python manage.py shell

from ModelTest_app.models import Contact
Contact.objects.all()
c = Contact()
c.first_name = "Tom"
c.last_name = "Bombadil"
c.mobile = "5551234"
c.save()

Django supports ORM through models
All model classes inherit from the models.Model class
Model attributes map to database table fields
Python comes with the SQLite DBMS
Django projects are pre-configured to use SQLite, but can also use other DBMSs
To  populate our database, we must first run the migrate command
We run the makemigrations command followed by the migrate command after adding a new model or modifying an existing one
SQLite has a free GUI-based administration application called SQLite Database Browser available, which you can use to view your project database and its tables
You can populate your models with data through the Python shell

## Administration Intro
